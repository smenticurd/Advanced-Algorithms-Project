# Advanced-Algorithms-Project
Plan 


Milestone 1: Design the graph data structure and implement the algorithms (Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford)

1.1. Create a Vertex class to represent a location. This class will have attributes for the vertex name, distance, congestion ratio, and transport velocity.

1.2. Create an Edge class to represent a connection between two vertices. This class will have attributes for the start vertex, end vertex, weight, congestion ratio, and transport velocity.

1.3. Create a Graph class that will hold the vertices and edges. Implement methods for adding vertices and edges to the graph.

1.4. Implement Dijkstra's algorithm in a separate class named DijkstraAlgorithm. This class will have a method that takes a graph and two vertices as input and returns the shortest path between them.

1.5. Implement Bellman-Ford's algorithm in a separate class named BellmanFordAlgorithm. This class will have a method that takes a graph and two vertices as input and returns the shortest path between them.

Milestone 2: Implement the functions for reading input data from a text file and populating the graph

2.1. Create a method in the Graph class to read input data from a text file. The text file will contain information about vertices and edges, including distance, congestion ratio, and transport velocity.

2.2. Implement a method to populate the graph with the data read from the text file.

Milestone 3: Implement the trie search function and the MSD string sort function

3.1. Implement a Trie class to represent a trie data structure.

3.2. Implement a method in the Trie class to search for a specific vertex in the graph using the trie data structure.

3.3. Implement a method in the Graph class to sort all vertices in alphabetical order using MSD string sort.

Milestone 4: Generate the comparison tables and test the application with sample data

4.1. Create a class to generate tables for comparison of the algorithms' performance and the shortest paths found.

4.2. Create a method to calculate the average execution time of each algorithm.

4.3. Test the application with sample data, and generate tables for comparison.

Milestone 5: Prepare documentation and deliver the final project

5.1. Write documentation on how to use the application and interpret the results.

5.2. Package the Java source code files, sample text file, tables, and documentation into a single deliverable.

5.3. Submit the final project for review.
